# Etch-A-Sketch

This small project is to create an Etch-A-Sketch using Javascript to showcase the dynamics of a website. You are able to hover your mouse 
over the small grid box and create images. You are also able to change the grid size. This was an introduction to showcase
how to manipulate DOM structures. 

You may visit https://kazushir.github.io/Etch-A-Sketch/ to see how this functions.
